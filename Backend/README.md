# Plagiarism Checker – Python

This project is a Python-based plagiarism checker that detects similarity between text documents using **Cosine Similarity**.  
It compares multiple text files and identifies how closely related they are based on content similarity.

## 📌 How It Works

Plagiarism detection is achieved by converting raw textual data into numerical vectors.  
Since computers work efficiently with numbers, this approach allows us to calculate similarity using mathematical techniques.

Steps involved:
- Convert text documents into vectors
- Apply cosine similarity
- Generate similarity scores for each document pair

This repository provides a simple and practical implementation of this concept.
